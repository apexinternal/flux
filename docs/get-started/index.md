# Get started

All you need is a Kubernetes cluster and a git repo. The git repo
contains [manifests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/)
(as YAML files) describing what should run in the cluster. Flux imposes
[some requirements](../requirements.md) on these files.

## Installing Flux

Here are the instructions to [install Flux on your own
cluster](../tutorials/get-started).

If you are using Helm, we have a [separate section about
this](../tutorials/get-started-helm).
